Overview:

The design principle for the "Unified AI Tool" is to create a software application that combines various AI tools into one window, providing users with a seamless and integrated experience. The design will be influenced by Blender 2.79, utilizing its layout concept to offer multiple windows within a single workspace.


Modular Window Layout:

a. Multiple Windows: The application will feature multiple windows that cater to different AI functionalities, such as image generation, chat, audio processing, video editing, etc.

b. Top Links: Each window will have a corresponding link at the top, allowing users to switch between different AI modules effortlessly.

c. Non-disruptive Workflow: Users can work on different windows simultaneously without losing their progress, ensuring a smooth transition between tasks.


Window-specific Tools:

a. Left Panel: The left side of the interface will house domain-specific tools relevant to the active window. For example, when working in the image window, image-related tools like filters, transformations, and editing options will be readily accessible.

b. Right Panel: General-purpose tools and utilities that apply to multiple AI modules will be placed in the right panel. These tools could include settings, preferences, global shortcuts, or options that enhance the overall user experience.


Consistent Design Language:

a. Visual Cohesion: The overall interface design will maintain a consistent visual language throughout the application, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

b. Iconography: Clear and recognizable icons will be used to represent tools and functions, allowing users to quickly identify and utilize the features they need.


Customizability and Flexibility:

a. Window Arrangement: Users will have the ability to arrange and resize windows according to their preference, enabling a personalized workspace tailored to their specific needs.

b. Tool Customization: Users can customize the layout of tool panels, enabling them to prioritize frequently used tools or organize them based on their workflow.


Seamless Data Integration:

a. Cross-Window Interaction: The application will allow users to easily share data and information between different windows. For example, outputs from one AI module can be directly used as inputs in another, eliminating the need for manual data transfer.

b. Context Preservation: User context and data will be preserved across different windows, ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted workflow.


By adopting a design inspired by Blender 2.79, the "Unified AI Tool" aims to provide a familiar, efficient, and customizable environment where users can leverage various AI functionalities seamlessly, while keeping their work organized and accessible across different modules.
